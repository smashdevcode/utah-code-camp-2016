Write up notes for demos

Demos
    Simple class and method decorators
        Just initially log statements
        Show the arguments that are passed
    Walk through generated code?
    What can we do with property descriptors?
        Show property descriptor demos
    Setup "readonly" decorator
    Setup Angular 1.x "controller" decorator
        Registers controller
        Adds "$inject" static property
    Show Angular 2 demo






Create ngForward demos
    Just write a version of my demo app using ngForward???
    Or create a small, simple demo???

Look for libraries that make Angular 1.x controllers look more like Angular 2 components

Metadata Reflection API (by Jonathan Turner)

Experiment with class, method, and parameter decorators
    What can you do with each of these???

What does support for decorators look like in Babel???
    Babel 5 had support
    Babel 6 currently does not... but you can add back support via a plug-in

Review MDN documentation for...
    Proxy
