# Using TypeScript Decorators with Angular

TypeScript decorators, based on the ES2016 decorator proposal and introduced as part of TypeScript 1.5, provide developers with a way to modify a JavaScript class, property, method, or method parameter using a convenient declarative syntax. We'll start this session by creating our own decorator, to see firsthand how they work. Then, we'll take a look at how decorators are used when creating Angular 2 components. Lastly, we'll see how to use decorators with AngularJS 1 controllers to make them look more syntactically similar to Angular 2 components.

This session is for developers who are using (or interested in using) TypeScript with AngularJS 1 or Angular 2.
